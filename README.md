# Retargetable-HyC

9/25/2017:
The plan for R-HyC is it to be written C++ and will compile C & C++ programs.  R-HyC will be related to working with LLVM and working in relation with IR that is produced.  R-HyC will focus on working with neural network software and A.I. development.  FPGAs will be used as the hardware to retarget code to particular architectures.
